# Community Management Troubleshooting Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Service Initialization Error
**Problem**: `Error in getActiveMembers: [Error: Please sign in to view the member list.]` during module loading.

**Solution**: Implemented lazy initialization for services to prevent async calls during module import.

**Files Modified**:
- `services/membersService.ts` - Added lazy singleton pattern
- `services/communityFeedService.ts` - Added lazy singleton pattern
- Removed conflicting `.js` files: `permissionManager.js`, `mockAuth.js`

### 2. üîß Database Schema Cache Issue
**Problem**: `Could not find the table 'public.posts' in the schema cache`

**Status**: Identified but requires manual fix in Supabase dashboard.

**Solution**:
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run this command to refresh the schema cache:
   ```sql
   NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';
   ```
4. If that doesn't work, run the full table recreation SQL from the diagnostic script

## Diagnostic Tools

### Quick Health Check
```bash
node scripts/testCommunityApp.js
```

### Database Diagnosis
```bash
node scripts/diagnoseCommunityIssue.js
```

### Table Accessibility Test
```bash
node scripts/simplePostsSetup.js
```

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Service Architecture**: Fixed initialization issues
‚úÖ **Permission System**: Working correctly
‚úÖ **Database Tables**: Created but need schema cache refresh
‚ö†Ô∏è **Posts Table**: Exists but not accessible via API (cache issue)

## Next Steps

1. **Restart your app** - The service initialization error should be resolved
2. **Fix database cache** - Follow the Supabase dashboard instructions above
3. **Test functionality** - Once cache is refreshed, all features should work

## Features Implemented

### Task 4.1: Post Creation Permission Control ‚úÖ
- Only members can create posts
- Proper error messages for non-members
- UI shows/hides based on permissions
- Integration with permission manager

### Task 4.2: Post Display Updates ‚úÖ
- Database-driven post retrieval
- Author information display
- Permission-controlled deletion
- Enhanced UI with loading states

## Service Usage

The services now use lazy initialization:

```typescript
// Old way (caused initialization errors)
import { membersService } from './services/membersService';

// New way (works correctly)
import { membersService } from './services/membersService';
// Service is initialized only when first method is called
const members = await membersService.getActiveMembers(userId);
```

## Testing

After restarting your app:
1. Navigate to the Community tab
2. You should see proper loading states
3. If logged in as a member, you should see the post creation form
4. If not logged in, you should see appropriate messages

If you still see database errors, follow the Supabase dashboard fix above.
